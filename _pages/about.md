I am a second year Master student from [Applied Mathematics](https://www.apam.columbia.edu/programs/applied-mathematics), Columbia University. My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical frameworks and computational approaches in optimization and data science.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Vladimir A. Kobzar](https://math.osu.edu/people/kobzar.1) from [Department of Mathematics](https://math.osu.edu/), Ohio State University. 

Here is my [CV](../assets/CV.pdf).

Here are some publications & Preprints:
[Lower Bounds on Block-Diagonal SDP Relaxations for the Clique Number of the Paley Graphs and Their Localizations](../assets/paley_paper.pdf)
Yifan Wang, Yanling Shen, and Vladimir A. Kobzar
In Proceeding, 2025
Submitted for review
[Poster](../assets/Paley_poster.pdf) presented at Foundations of Data Science Workshop at Data Science Institute, Columbia University.
